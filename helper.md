# nodejs-grpc-boilerplate
This project builds a scalable gRPC  in Node.js, enabling fast, secure, and efficient inter-service communication. gRPC, a high-performance RPC framework by Google, supports language-agnostic, type-safe communication. By implementing Protocol Buffers, HTTP/2, and TLS, this project enhances speed, security, and reliability with Node.js services.


# protocol buffers
Protocol Buffers is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible way of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more. It is a language-agnostic, type-safe, and efficient mechanism for serializing structured data. Protocol Buffers are used to define the structure of the data that is being sent between services. This structure is defined in a .proto file, which is then compiled into the language-specific classes that are used to serialize and deserialize the data.

# RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network without having to understand the network's details. RPC is a high-level communication protocol that allows a client and a server to communicate over a network. The client sends a request to the server, and the server processes the request and sends a response back to the client. RPC is used to build distributed systems, where different services communicate with each other over a network.

# gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. It is built on top of Protocol Buffers, HTTP/2, and TLS, and it provides language-agnostic, type-safe communication between services. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define the structure of the data that is being sent between services, and it uses HTTP/2 for transport and TLS for security. gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, flow control, and error handling, making it a powerful and efficient way to build distributed systems.
